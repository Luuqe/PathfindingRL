# PathfindingRL
Reinforcement learning program based on pathfinding. The goal is to have the agent start in a position in the maze and navigate through walls to the end of the maze.


The program does not currently have a GUI. As such it is ran inside an IDE.
Due to this being a reinforcement learning program the more itirations ran the better the result path will be.
Make sure to set the amount of iterations you'd like to run.

Inputs;
Maze size: The maze size entered will give a certain sized grid where Y will be converted to a YxY grid.
Density: This is the percentage of the grid that will be randomly populated with walls.
